Create a Pressure Controller
A client expects to you to deliver the software of the following system:
- Specification from the client:
- A pressure controller informs the crew of a cabin with an alarm when the pressure exceeds 20 bars in the cabin.
- The alarm duration equals 60 seconds.
The system should have:
1- Requirement Diagram
2- System Analysis
  - Use Case Diagram
  - Activity Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram
3- System Design(Modules with its own state machines)
4- You have write Embedded C codes consists of modules
  - .c/.h files of each module
  - MakeFile
  - Startup.c
  - Linker.ld
5- In the driver.c file we provide the following APIS
  - void Delay(int nCount);
  - int detPressureVal();
  - void Set_Alarm_actuator(int i);
  - void GPIO_INITIALIZATION();
